**WallhavenUI: A Beautiful Wallpapers Browser**
---------------------------------------------

### Project Title
WallhavenUI is a lightweight, feature-rich application that allows you to browse and search wallpapers from Wallhaven.cc in a beautiful and user-friendly interface.

### Description
I built this to provide an easy-to-use experience for those who love browsing wallpapers. With WallhavenUI, you can quickly access the latest wallpapers, top-rated images, or explore random picks with just a few clicks. The app also includes a search bar where you can find your favorite wallpapers by keyword.

### Features

* Browse latest wallpapers from Wallhaven.cc
* Search for wallpapers using keywords
* Access top-rated wallpapers and random picks
* Open wallpaper in default browser for further exploration
* Clean, intuitive design with navigation buttons and scrollable thumbnails

One cool feature is the ability to load thumbnails directly into the app without requiring a separate browser window. I'm thinking about adding more features like saving favorite wallpapers or displaying detailed information about each image.

### Installation
To run WallhavenUI, you'll need:

* Python 3.x (preferably the latest version)
* PyQt6 library for GUI development
* `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` libraries for web scraping

You can install required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pyqt6 requests beautifulsoup4
```
To run the app, simply execute `python main.py` in your terminal.

### Usage
1. Run the application using `python main.py`.
2. Use navigation buttons to browse through different sections (latest, top-rated, random).
3. Enter keywords in the search bar to find specific wallpapers.
4. Click on a thumbnail to open the wallpaper in your default browser.

Feel free to contribute by suggesting new features or reporting any issues you encounter! This project is open-source and I'm excited to collaborate with fellow developers.
